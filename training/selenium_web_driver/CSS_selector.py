#  sometimes the id's are dynamic to catch them there are several ways

# if the prefix is stable but the ending is changing use ˆ sign  (alt + I) like this : input [idˆ= "dl_lkj_ "]
# if the suffix is stable  use the $ sign like this : input [id$ = "_df_lku_"]
# if the sub-string is stable use * sign like this : input [id* = "_df_lku_"]
